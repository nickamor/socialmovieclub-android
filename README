'Social Movie Club' for COSC2309 Mobile Application Development,
Semester 2 2015, Assignment 2

API Level: 21

For the marker: few features are implemented. What works: online searching, chain-of-responsibility,
some model persistence. Worker threads are used to access the model. The memory model does use LRU access.
The detail view uses some simple Fragments, not to the extent of making it tablet-friendly though.

USAGE:

Once the main interface appears, begin by searching for a movie. Your search results
should appear after a moment. Selecting any of these will display a detail view page.
